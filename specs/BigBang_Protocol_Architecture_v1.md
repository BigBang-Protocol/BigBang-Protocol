BigBang Protocol – Architecture Specification (v1.0)
Prepared for: Developers, System Integrators, CAs, and Regulatory Review
## 1. Introduction
The BigBang Protocol is a cryptographic trust enforcement layer built on top of classical and post-quantum signature models. It replaces outdated models of digital signatures with TrustEnvelopes — structured, signed, and policy-bound actions — verified in real time through Trust-as-a-Service (TaaS) nodes.
## 2. Core Concepts
* TrustEnvelope: A structured object containing actor, intent, target, signature, timestamp, and policy.
* TaaS (Trust-as-a-Service): Real-time verification engine for envelopes.
* Actor: Entity performing an action; can be human or machine.
* Intent: Declared purpose of the action.
* Policy: Rules governing actor permission, signature validity, and action constraints.
## 3. TrustEnvelope Structure (JSON Schema)
* actor:
* name
* role
* certificate_serial
* public_key
* action:
* type
* target
* intent
* timestamp
* message_hash
* envelope_nonce
* signature:
* algorithm (e.g., ECDSA + Dilithium)
* value
* policy:
* policy_id
* verification_uri
## 4. TaaS Verification Flow
* Input: TrustEnvelope + optional trust_policy.json
* Checks:
* Signature validity (algorithms)
* Certificate status (OCSP/CRL or internal registry)
* Actor role enforcement
* Message hash match
* Envelope expiration
* Nonce uniqueness
* Output: Verification result (valid, invalid, revoked, expired, tampered)
## 5. Security Layers
* Dual Signature (Classical + PQC)
* Signed Timestamp and Envelope Nonce
* Message Hash Binding (file or content)
* Revocation Lookup (Live or Embedded)
* Actor Scope Verification
* Envelope Replay Protection
* Audit Log with Envelope Chain
## 6. Supported Cryptographic Standards
* Classical: RSA, ECDSA (NIST curves)
* PQC: Dilithium2/3, Kyber (future)
* Hashing: SHA-256, SHA-3 (Keccak), BLAKE3 (optional)
* Time: RFC 3161 Timestamp Authority (TSA)
## 7. Deployment Models
* Local signer (CLI or SDK)
* On-prem TaaS verifier
* Federated TaaS cluster (multi-CA or enterprise)
* Cloud-native verifier (e.g., AWS Lambda + API Gateway)
* Offline verifier (with snapshot revocation list)
## 8. Integration Hooks
* API Gateways (header signature enforcement)
* Kubernetes Admission Controllers
* CI/CD Pipelines (envelope-signed builds)
* Email Clients (trust-verified email content)
* Document Signing (with or without PDF)
* Blockchain Anchoring (optional hash commitment)
## 9. Policy Framework
* Role-bound actor permissions
* Filetype and content constraints (e.g., disallow .exe, macros)
* Trust window (validity in minutes)
* Required signer quorum (multi-actor)
* Signing method whitelist
10. Logging and Auditing
* Signed trust logs
* Envelope outcome (accepted, rejected, bypassed)
* Actor behavior logs
* TaaS audit trails
* Optional blockchain anchoring
