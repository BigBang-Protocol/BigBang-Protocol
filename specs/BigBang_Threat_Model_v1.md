## 1. Protocol-Level Threats
* Signature Algorithm Downgrade: Enforce approved algorithm lists in TrustPolicy.
* Timestamp Spoofing: Require time-source binding via TSA or HSM.
* Nonce Reuse: Introduce unique envelope nonce and anti-replay logic.
* Revocation Propagation: Sync revocation across distributed TaaS nodes.
* Manual Envelope Construction: Only allow SDK-generated + schema-validated envelopes.
## 2. Supply Chain & Build-Time Threats
* Compromised SDK: SDK fingerprinting + CA validation.
* Backdoored TaaS Node: Federated TaaS with verifier reputation scoring.
* Dependency Tampering: Sign packages using SLSA/SigStore.
* CI/CD Token Exposure: Token hygiene + audit-signed build outputs.
## 3. Social Engineering & Trust Gaps
* Tricked signer: User prompt with policy explanation before sign.
* Unverified envelope acceptance: UI-level enforcement of verification warning.
* Misinterpreted envelope intent: Add “human readable” explainer field.
## 4. Legal, Governance & Standards Gaps
* Unrecognized format: Legal whitepaper + court-precedent validation.
* Revoked signer dispute: Bind action validity to sign-time trust.
* Fragmented CA trust: Define interoperable federation schema.
## 5. Quantum-Class Threats
* Weak PQC entropy: Enforce HSM-only PQC key gen.
* AI-generated envelope flooding: Introduce TaaS-side rate limiting + anomaly scoring.
* Deepfake actor certs: Future integration of biometric or multi-ID trust anchors.
## 6. System Integration Risks
* Fail-open defaults: TaaS must default to reject if envelope fails.
* Envelope tampering midstream: All changes detected via signed hash mismatch.
* Log flooding or poisoning: Rate limit and sign TaaS logs.
## 7. Metadata & Envelope Exploits
* Intent leakage: Support intent redaction mode.
* Hash inference: Allow salted/obfuscated hashes.
* Signature swap: Signature chaining + actor hash = protection.
## 8. Overlooked Technologies
* Docker: Sign image hash prior to deployment.
* Kubernetes: Integrate envelope validation into admission controller.
* KMS (AWS/GCP/Azure): Enable KMS-based actor keys for envelope signing.
* IaC Tools: Allow TrustEnvelopes on infrastructure manifests.
* CDN/Edge: Support envelope propagation without strip.
* ChatOps: Use envelopes for Slack/Teams bot commands.
* AI/LLM: Envelope-sign AI decisions or outputs.
## 9. Overlooked APIs & Integration
* Webhook signatures: Use BigBang to validate server-to-server hooks.
* gRPC: Envelope header as stream policy control.
* Envelope as API control layer: Add actor + scope to REST/GraphQL headers.
10. Cloud-Native & Microservice Enforcement
* Service-to-service trust: Envelope every interservice privileged call.
* Pod rollout/auth: Envelope authorize configmap/pod edits.
* Config changes: Hash + sign parameter edits (e.g., AWS SSM).
* Message bus: Use envelope-wrapped events in EventBridge/Kafka.
* Envelope storage: Cross-compatible with S3/GCS/Azure Blob.
* DevSecOps: Enforce envelope sign-off for CI/CD approval steps.
