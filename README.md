# BigBang Protocol

> **Verifiable intent. Enforced policy. Cryptographic governance.**

BigBang Protocol is a post-quantum ready cryptographic trust enforcement layer that transforms every digital action into a **verifiable, policy-bound, tamper-resistant TrustEnvelope**. Designed to replace assumptions with mathematical proof, BigBang ensures that **only authorized actions can occur — and only when policy permits them.**

---

## Features

- **TrustEnvelopes** — signed, structured objects that prove who did what, when, and under what role
- **Dual-Signature Crypto** — supports both classical (RSA/ECDSA) and post-quantum (Dilithium/Falcon)
- **TaaS (Trust-as-a-Service)** — real-time policy enforcement engine that validates or blocks actions
- **Cross-system Auditability** — verify trust even without access to the original system
- **Envelope Lifecycle** — from creation to archive, actions become legally portable cryptographic objects

---

## Generate a TrustEnvelope (CLI)

You can create a valid, policy-bound TrustEnvelope using the command-line builder included in this repo.

```bash
python examples/generate_envelope.py \
  --id alice@ministry.gov \
  --role finance.director \
  --action approve_fund_disbursement \
  --method pqc.dilithium3 \
  --scope RM500000
