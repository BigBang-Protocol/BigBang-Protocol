BigBang Protocol – Threat Mitigation Whitepaper (v1.0)

Prepared for: Regulators, CAs, CISOs, and System Architects

## Executive Summary
The BigBang Protocol introduces a structured and cryptographically enforceable trust layer across digital systems. It shifts digital signatures from static identifiers to structured, verifiable, policy-bound actions via TrustEnvelopes and real-time enforcement via Trust-as-a-Service (TaaS). This whitepaper presents the threat mitigation strategies implemented in BigBang, ensuring security, legal validity, and zero-trust compliance in modern and future-class systems.

## 1. Threat Taxonomy and Coverage
### BigBang addresses the following major classes of threats
* Identity spoofing and certificate misuse
* Message replay and tampering
* Encrypted content abuse (e.g., macro malware in DOCX)
* Certificate lifecycle failures (e.g., stale OCSP, revocation blind spots)
* Governance and legal gaps
* Emerging threats from AI and quantum computation
* System integration risks (CI/CD, API, K8s, DMS, email, etc.)

Each threat is mapped to enforcement policies embedded in TrustEnvelopes and validated through TaaS nodes.

## 2. TrustEnvelope Structure
### A TrustEnvelope contains
* Actor (identity, role, cert)
* Intent (declared purpose)
* Target (action, message, document hash)
* Timestamp (sign time)
* Signature (classical + PQC hybrid)
* Policy link (enforced rules)

This transforms signatures from “proof of identity” to “proof of intent + scope + timing.”

## 3. Trust-as-a-Service (TaaS)
### TaaS acts as a real-time validator
* Enforces actor roles and revocation
* Validates timestamp freshness and policy compliance
* Checks envelope structure, integrity, and nonce uniqueness
* Logs trust verification events for audit and non-repudiation

TaaS nodes may be internal, federated, or government-authorized.

## 4. Threat Mitigation Examples
### A. Malware in Encrypted Files
* Mitigated by envelope policy: pre-sign antivirus scan, file type whitelist, hash validation.

### B. Certificate still active but actor left the organization
* TaaS checks actor revocation registry and role-to-signer mapping.

### C. Message replay attack
* Each envelope includes a nonce and timestamp. TaaS rejects duplicates or stale actions.

### D. OCSP failure
* Envelopes include embedded time assertions or require signed time from a TSA.

### E. AI-generated envelope spam
* TaaS rate limiting and envelope entropy/behavior scoring in future roadmap.

## 5. Cloud & DevSecOps Integration
### BigBang supports
* Envelope-bound CI/CD approvals
* KMS-based key usage for signing
* Kubernetes admission control via envelope trust
* Envelope-wrapped events (Kafka, EventBridge)
* Webhook and REST API security via signed header injection

## 6. Compliance, Legal & Policy Alignment
* ISO 27001/27701: Supports traceability, access control, and auditability
* Evidence Act (MY/SG): Signed envelopes meet non-repudiation criteria
* eIDAS/eSign Act: Signature validity bound to policy + timestamp
* NIST PQC migration: Supports hybrid signatures (ECDSA + Dilithium)

## 7. Summary and Next Steps
BigBang redefines what digital trust means. No longer just “who signed”, but “who did what, when, and under what policy.”

### Next actions
* Work with NIST, eIDAS, etc
