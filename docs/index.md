# Welcome to BigBang Protocol

> Cryptographic Trust for a Post-Quantum World

BigBang Protocol replaces unverifiable actions with **signed, policy-bound TrustEnvelopes**.  
Every action is governed by protocol logic — not just logs or access rights.

- [Sample Envelope (Invalid)](../examples/invalid_envelope.json)
- [Trust Policy Spec](../specs/sample_trust_policy.json)
- [Verifier Logic](../examples/verify.py)

## How It Works

1. An actor performs an action (e.g. “Approve RM500,000”)
2. It’s wrapped in a TrustEnvelope with ID, role, scope, and timestamp
3. Signed using PQC + classical crypto
4. Verified against policy via TaaS or GitHub Action

## Governance in Code

BigBang Protocol introduces:
- Role-based envelope control
- PQC-ready enforcement
- Portable, legal-grade audit trail
- Optional blockchain anchoring
